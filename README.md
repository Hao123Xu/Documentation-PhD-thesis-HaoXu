This documentation includes:

1. Segment bone and vessels of mice tibia in 3D SR-micro CT images using marker controlled watershed and monogenic signal phase asymmetry.
This algorithm can be divided into:
- Control surface generation (Matlab program)
- Marker generation and watershed processing (Bash shell script and ITK)
2. Structural parameter measurement (ITK function and Matlab program)
3. Statistical analysis (R language)
4. 3D Synthetic volume generation (OpenSCAD)
