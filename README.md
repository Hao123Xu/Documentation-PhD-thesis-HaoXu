# Bone-vasculature-segmentation

Segment bone and vessels of mice tibia in 3D SR-micro CT images using marker controlled watershed and monogenic signal phase asymmetry.

This algorithm can be divided into:
1. Control surface generation
2. Marker generation and watershed processing
3. Quantitative parameter measurement
