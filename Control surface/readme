This folder is about the generation of control surface images by measuring local phase asymmetry.

To generate .mhd files for the later step of watershed segmentation:

1. Calculate 3D local phase asymmetry using matlab program "Test_3D_LocalPhase_Asymmetry.m"
2. Save the generated results of 3D local phase asymmetry as .mhd files using "Test_save_ControlSurface_mhd.ijm" (imagej Macro script)
3. Rename the .mhd files using a bash shell script "Test_loop_rename.sh"
