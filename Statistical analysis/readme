Statistical analysis is performed using R:

- Test normality: Lilliefors test. 
- Test homoscedasticity: Bartlett's test.
- Test whether there is a significant difference across the groups: ANOVA test.
- Test the effect sizes after ANOVA: Eta squared (η^2) (Albers and Lakens, 2018). 
- Identify which group is significantly different from the other: Post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test.
- Detect outliers: Grubbs's test.
